Checksums
=========

Create and verify GPG-signed MD5 checksums for all files in a
directory tree.


Rationale
---------

The general purpose of creating checksums for files and comparing
them over time is to determine whether files have changed. Either
accidentally or maliciously.

Several intrusion detection systems already exist that serve this
purpose, among other things. So why this script?

* I don't want to bother with the complexities of an 
  enterprise-grade IDS.

* I don't want a central database of checksums.
  Instead, I want one checksum file (.checksums) per directory,
  in order to be able to easily copy directories around and still
  be able to verify their checksums.

* Incremental creation/update of checksums.
  Assuming that I/you trust data integrity on the system where
  the checksums are generated.
